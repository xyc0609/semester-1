# Week 1.5, Session 1: Task 4

# Add one or more import statements here to give this program
# access to the Point and Circle classes defined in geometry.py
import math
# Write a program here that
#  - Creates a Point object, to represent the centre of a circle
#  - Creates a Circle object, using the Point object and a value for radius
#  - Displays the area of the circle
#  - Displays the perimeter of the circle
from geometry import Point, Circle

center = Point(3,4)
circle = Circle(center, 5)

print("Area:", circle.area())
print("Perimeter:", circle.perimeter())
print("center:", circle.center.x, circle.center.y)
